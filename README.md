## Introduction

- Semantic-live is an extension that provides you with many useful functionalities including a live previewer for html, js & css including semmantic-UI library
- Why [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com) ? It is an awesome library with excellent components that you can use to quickly
  build web interfaces. But I felt like it would be nicer if we can compose bunch of elements and see in realtime how they
  fit together. That's why Semantic-live.
